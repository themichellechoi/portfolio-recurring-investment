# Recurring Investment Dashboard </br>
Overview Dashboard Tracking the Performance of Recurring Investment </br>


## Introduction & Purpose
The dashboard features the overview of the recurring investment. The purpose of the dashboard is to monitor the product performance. The possible business questions arising from the dashboards are like the following: 
1. About 28% of the users are participating in recurring investment. Is this the best or can we convert more users?
2. Which part of the set-up funnel can be improved?

</br></br>


## Facts
1. The new user trend has been quite steady.
2. 


</br></br>


## Suggestions
Here are some suggestions to increase activation of the recurring investment product. </br>
1. Performing AB tests for the set-up page. A lot of users stay on the stock choosing page. However the nubmer significantly drops at choose period page. A lot of different experiment can be done. Some of the hypothesis that can be tested are:
   1. The funnel may be too long. Create a shorter version and compare the conversion.
   2. The conversion rate of users moving to choosing period page is already quite low. Perhaps we can try to switch the order of the pages.
3.Try to analyze through which route the new users access the recurring investment page.
  1. If it's mostly marketing problem, we can try to diversify marketing sources.
  2. Try to change the click location of the recurring investment section of the app in case visibility is the problem.

> ### Notes
> I tried to create a simple version of an overview dashboard. All of the data are generated using ChatGPT. In real world, I'd looked at more specific metrics, like the average time it took for the users to start investing since they join the app. Another metric that I actually used was the average amount of money the users commit per month; by looking at this metric I tried to figure out the maximum amount of commitment per month.
